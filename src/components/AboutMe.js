        I'm a Software Engineer with experience in graphic design, marketing,
        photography, & sales. For the past two years I’ve been heading up
        business development & operations management for a small startup team. I
        oversee content creation for product packaging, catalogs, company
        websites and social media. As Director of Operations I work closely with
        the company’s founders on sourcing and developing products, designing
        and manufacturing packaging, and managing the customer database and
        sales team. I thrive in an environment that continually challenges me
        and forces me out of my comfort zone.
